**AI Chat is a cross-platform desktop application that provides quick access to chatbots like OpenAI ChatGPT from the menu bar (tray).**

By having it reside on the menu bar, we eliminate the need to switch between windows when using ChatGPT as our daily assistant. It also enables us to have a streamlined workflow, as we can easily multitask and communicate with the AI without interrupting our current tasks.
